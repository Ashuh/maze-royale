## Mechanics (TODO)

- Fog of war: Players are only able to see objects within a limited field of view.
- Aiming: Players can aim by holding down the right mouse button. While aiming,
  - Camera will move more towards the mouse position, allowing the player to see objects further away.
  - Shot spread is reduced (not implemented yet).
  - Movement speed is reduced (not implemented yet).
  - Field of view is greatly reduced.
